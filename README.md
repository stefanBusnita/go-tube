# go-tube

Simple event publisher listener for in-app uses. Main idea is ditching unnecessary dependencies between components, and just trigger the event, while a listener service will do all the required action. Testing should be easier since the only mock active would be the gotube one, and checking the payload is sent as expected, therefore no additional work would be required.

# NOTE

Still in progress, just a MVP for now. No testing or other improvements are present.
